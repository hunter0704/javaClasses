	// 4 MAIN oops Concepts:
	//1) Inheritance -->Procces of subClass accessing all properties and behavior of super class
	// Types of Inheritance ->Single,MultiLevel,Hieracial,Multiple (Availble only with concept of Interfaces),
	//Hybrid(Combination of 2 more )
    
	//2)Polymorphism->Procces when objet can take many behavior or form.
	// Two Typs of Polymorephism->Static Polymorphism /EarlyBinding/CompileTime->achieved thorgh method overloading
	//Dynamic Polymorphism/lateBinding/RunTime-->avhieved throgh methods overridding
	
	//3) Abstraction->Procces of hiding implementation details achieved throgh Abstract Classes and Interface
	
	//4) Encapusulation->procces of wrapping variables and methods in a single unit
	//Encapsulation-> Combinning of state and behavior in a single container is known as Encapsulation
